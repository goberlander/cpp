CISC205 - CLASSES - PROGRAM 4


--- FROM BLACKBOARD
Functional Requirements:

Write a menu-driven program for my friend, Dr. Patty, who is a surgeon, that will keep track of patient charges.

1.  Enter new patient

2.  Edit patient

3.  Display patient information

4.  Exit

Programming Requirements:

1.  Create a Patient class that has member variables for the following:

Patient ID:                      int  >= 0

Patient Name:                string < 25 chars

Patient Address:            string < 50 chars

Patient Phone:               string < 11 chars

Surgery Charges:            float >= 0

-----------------------

The class should have a default constructor and second constructor which accepts arguments for each member variable.  It should also have accessor and mutator functions for each member variable.   Mutator functions that are passed invalid data should cause an exit_failure.

In main, declare an array of 5 Patient objects.  

Use the format from earlier programs to drive the program.  However, remember that this data is private and can only be accessed or changed via the member functions.

In order to get full credit, you must have modular code, your output must look professional, and you must have well-documented code. Please review all past grading notes from Kevin, and make sure to incorporate those changes into this program.

------------------------

Submit to us:

1.  all files (.h and .cpp)

2.  URL to a jing that shows the program working and also shows validation

*******************************************************************************************************************************
OR, if this sounds boring because you have already taken 187 from me, then we will give you 5 points of EC  if you implement Problem 13-20 in addition to the Patient class program outlined above.   (Problem 13-20 is the Patient Fees problem.)  
EDIT:  If you choose to do 13-20, I would want you to complete the program above (the Patient class) with these changes:
1.  Do not implement the Surgery Charges member of the Patient class (because this will be handled by the Patient Account class)
2.  Add a menu item called "Discharge Patient".   In this menu item,  you can implement the classes as described in 13-20 and ultimately display the patient information along with the total charges.  
We are encouraging creativity.  The only rules for this add-on EC is that you have to accomplish what the Problem 13-20 describes and you have to make it tie in with the program as described above.  Come on, let's see what you can do!


--- FROM BOOK
 You are to write a program that computes a patient’s bill for a hospital stay. The
different components of the program are
The PatientAccount class
The Surgery class
The Pharmacy class
The main program

– The PatientAccount class will keep a total of the patient’s charges. It will also
keep track of the number of days spent in the hospital. The group must decide
on the hospital’s daily rate.
	- totalCharges
	- totalDays, addDay()
	- hospital's daily rate
	- 

– The Surgery class will have stored within it the charges for at least five types
of surgery. It can update the charges variable of the PatientAccount class.

– The Pharmacy class will have stored within it the price of at least five types of
medication. It can update the charges variable of the PatientAccount class.

– The student who designs the main program will design a menu that allows the
user to enter a type of surgery and a type of medication, and check the patient
out of the hospital. When the patient checks out, the total charges should be
displayed.



MENU OPTIONS
1. Add new patient
	- input a unique ID (>=0), 
	- their name (< 25 chars), 
	- address (< 50 chars), 
	- phone (< 11 chars), 
2. Edit patient account
	- change name, address, phone
	- add medical charges
- discharge patient
	- display patients information with medical costs and cost of stay (@$50/day)
	- 
- exit program
 


--- CLASSES ---


PatientAccount
	- keeps track of the charges. DONE
	- keeps track of number of days... That can be calculated.  
Surgery Class
	- list of 5 surgeries and their cost
	- can access the charges variable of PatientAccount

PharmaCharges
	- list of 5 medications and their cost
